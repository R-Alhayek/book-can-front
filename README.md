## Overview
Building a CRUD APP that allows the user to login, logout, and shows the user's favorite books.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
React.js / React Bootstrap / Auth0

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
